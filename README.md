# rraft-py

This crate provides a Python binding for the [tikv/raft-rs](https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs) crate, allowing for integration of the Raft consensus algorithm in Python applications.

The `raft-rs` crate implements the Raft consensus algorithm, which is a widely used and well-documented method for maintaining a replicated state machine in a distributed system.

Whether you're building a distributed database, a highly-available service, or any other type of application that requires consensus among a set of nodes, this binding makes it simple to get started.

## Getting started
